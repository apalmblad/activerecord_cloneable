Activerecord-cloneable
======================

This is a quick tool to help clone active records.

Let's say you have a great rails app, and you want to quickly add clone
functionality to an object.  Use this.

Example
=======

Basic:

cloned_record = record.clone_record

By default, we'll look at belongs to relations, and clone those to.  Often,
that's not desireable.  We might want to share some of the parents with our
clone.

Then, 
cloned_record = record.clone_record( :shared_parents => [:belongs_to_association_name]

We might want to set up some attributes on our cloned record.

cloned_record = record.clone_record( :attributes => { :name => "Ima Clone" } )

Finally, everyone knows that clones you cannot tell apart are a plot device for
a scifi movie.  Therefore, by default, if a name or title attribute is present,
it's marked to indicate that the cloned object is a copy.  If you have another
string field that you want to indicate as such, pass them in:

cloned_record = record.clone_record( :name_fields => [ :name_title] )


Disclaimer
==========

This scratches an itch for me.  I don't know if it will scratch an itch for you.
It might ruin your day -- or worse.  I haven't tested this nearly as well as I
should.  If you send in problem reports, I'll try and fix them.  No waranties.
